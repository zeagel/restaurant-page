          <li>This is one of my favorite places. This was one of the best mouth-watering wokp plate I've had grace my taste buds in a long time. The waiter was prompt and polite. I'd give more than 5 stars if I could!</li>
          <li>I felt like this place wasn't trying hard enough. The beef wok was a little dry. I felt the prices were too high given the quality of the food. The ambiance gives off an earthy feel-good vibe. The service wasn't that good and the waiter was rude. Satisfactory experience, will come again.</li>
          <li>Gross! I think this place was featured on Kitchen Nightmares, or at least it should have been. Seriously, how difficult is it to get a clean glass around here? I wish I could put a sign out front that said "DON'T EAT HERE!"</li>
